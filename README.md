# Work Day Scheduler

<img src="assets/images/readme-screenshot.jpg" alt="Example of work day scheduler">

## Background
For one of our coding bootcamp's challenge assignments, we were tasked with use primarily third party APIs and JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, to create a functional work day scheduler.

## Functionality
* When the user opens the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When the user scrolls down, then they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
* When the user views the time blocks for that day, then they notice that each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).
* When the user clicks into a time block, then they can enter an event.
* When the user clicks the save button for that particular time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When the user refreshs the page, then the saved events continue to display on the page as they were before refreshing.
